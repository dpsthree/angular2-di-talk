            <div>Dependency Injection (DI) consists of three parts</div>
            <ul>
                <li>An Injector</li>
                <li>Bindings</li>

                Di in Angular2 is a core feature of the framework. It was one of the primary motivators behind Angular 2 and is one of the more mature pieces.
                In fact it is so well polished that it can and has been used independently of the rest of framework. See Tero Parvainein's work integrating with backbone
                At the heart of the DI system are three pieces: Injectors, bindings and Instances

        <section><h2>Injectors</h2>
            <h3>Root Injector</h3>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
bootstrap(MyApp, [MyService])
            </code></pre>
            <h3>Child Injectors</h3>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
...
@View({
    bindings: [MyService2]
})
...
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
                In order for Angular to inject dependencies there must be an Injector. The injector is responsible for supplying the requested dependencies.
                When you bootstrap an application Angular will create a root Injector on your behalf. This is the set of dependencies that can be accessed
                across the application. As an application grows additional components may have unique requirements outsie of what the root injector can provide.
                When that is the case a child injector (created for each component) can be instructed on how to provide additional types of instances.
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section><h2>Bindings</h2>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
bootstrap(MyApp, [MyService])
            </code></pre>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
...
@View({
    bindings: [MyService2]
})
...
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
                ...and the injectors are instructed by using bindings. The code that was shown is not the creation of the injectors rather it supplies the bindings
                needed to inform it what to inject and how. This is highly sugared niceness. 
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section><h2>Instances</h2>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
...
@Component({
    selector: 'my-app'
})
class MyApp {
    constructor(myServiceInstance: MyService)
}
...
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
                Its at this point, in the constructor, that we are actually requesting an instance from the injector. How it should be created/Which instance is determined
                by the Injector Hiearchy and the bindings that were supplied to configure it. 
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
            Let's see some more code
        </section>
        <section>
            <img src="images/parent.PNG">
            <aside class="notes">
                In the above sample line 3 creates a binding to “MyUtilsService”. This informs Angular that ParentComponent needs a fresh injector
                to provide access to MyUtilsService. The reference to MyUtilsService on line 9 is the actual request to perform injection.
                At this point Angular will create a new instance of MyUtilsService which is available in ParentComponent’s constructor.
                
                Let’s add another piece.
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
            <img src="images/child1.PNG">
            <aside class="notes">
                In this example ChildComponent1 is also referencing an injection of MyUtilsService. Since a binding was not specified
                for MyUtilsService on ChildComponent1 Angular injects the same instance that was created for the ParentComponent.
                But what if we wanted a new instance? Let’s say that ParentComponent manipulates the state of MyUtilsService in some
                way that makes its use undesirable in some additional child component. To achieve this a new instance would be needed
                instead of using the parent’s copy.

        <section>
            <img src="images/child2.PNG">
            <aside class="notes">
                Now a new instance of the MyUtilsService is requested on line 9 by creating a child injector. As a result,
                ChildComponent2’s constructor will be supplied with a different instance than was injected into the ParentComponent.
                Lets add one more layer and assume that ChildComponent2 is the only component in this hierarchy in need of a separate
                instance of MyUtilsService. ChildComponent2’s child wants to inject the same instance that was created for and injected
                into ParentComponent. One may assume the following approach can be taken:

        <section>
            <img src="images/grandchild.PNG">
            <aside class="notes">
                However, the GrandChildComponent is receiving a third instance of MyUtilsService. This is also not ideal.
                To correct this and achieve the desired result let’s revisit ChildComponent2 and make a few small adjustments.
            </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
            <img src="images/view bindings.PNG">
            <aside class="notes">
                View bindings allow for the creation of injectors that will create instances of an injectable that are only
                available to the component they are declared on. When MyUtilsService is injected into the GrandchildComponent the DI system will
                climb the hierarchy looking for an injector that is aware of MyUtilsService. The instance created by ChildComponent2 is
                not present in the hierarchy and instead the instance created on the ParentComponent is used.
